  "CanTrain": true,                can be true or false, case insensitive.  False means they will never train.  True means they will train as XP and gold permit.
  "RandomBanners": true,           uses default banners when false
  "XPGift": "NORMAL",              can be OFF, NORMAL, HARD, HARDEST, in CAPS.  HARDEST grants enough XP to significantly upgrade troops.  No effect if CanTrain is false.                                         
  "GoldReward": "NORMAL",          can be LOW, NORMAL, RICH, RICHEST, in CAPS.  This scales with the strength of the party, regardless.
  "CooldownHours": 24,             militias can't merge or split again before this much game time passes (minimum 1).
  "MinPartySize": 20,              integer.  Parties with fewer than this number of healthy troops will be dispersed, if defeated. 
  "MaxPartySize": 300,             integer lower than 2147483648.
  "RandomSplitChance": 0.25,       the daily probability a viable militia will split.
  "StrengthSplitFactor": 0.8,      militias will start randomly checking for split once they reach this threshold.           values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "SizeSplitFactor": 0.8,          militias will start randomly checking for split once they reach this threshold.           values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "PartyStrengthFactor": 0.8,      weakens the militias by scaling both strength and power to be less than the hero.         values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "MaxPartySizeFactor": 0.8,       weakens the militias by scaling both strength and power to be less than the hero.         values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "Growth": true,                  militias will grow on a daily basis
  "GrowthInPercent": 1,            each troop type in the militia will increase by this percentage (at least 1 extra unit is added)
  "MaxItemValue": 3000             limits the value of equipment given to the heroes (it's also subject to variance)
