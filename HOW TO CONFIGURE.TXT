  "CanTrain"                           can be true or false, case insensitive.  False means they will never train.  True means they will train as XP and gold permit.
  "RandomBanners"                      uses default banners when false.
  "XPGift"                             can be OFF, NORMAL, HARD, HARDEST, in CAPS.  HARDEST grants enough XP to significantly upgrade troops.  No effect if CanTrain is false.                                         
  "GoldReward"                         can be LOW, NORMAL, RICH, RICHEST, in CAPS.  This scales with the strength of the party, regardless.
  "CooldownHours"                      militias can't merge or split again before this much game time passes (minimum 1).
  "MinPartySize"                       integer.  Parties with fewer than this number of healthy troops will be dispersed, if defeated. 
  "MaxPartySize"                       integer lower than 2147483648.
  "RandomSplitChance"                  the daily probability a viable militia will split.
  "StrengthSplitFactor"                militias will start randomly checking for split once they reach this threshold.           values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "SizeSplitFactor"                    militias will start randomly checking for split once they reach this threshold.           values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "PartyStrengthFactor"                weakens the militias by scaling both strength and power to be less than the hero.         values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "MaxPartySizeFactor"                 weakens the militias by scaling both strength and power to be less than the hero.         values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "Growth"                             militias will grow on a daily basis.
  "GrowthInPercent"                    each troop type in the militia will increase by this percentage (at least 1 extra unit is always added if Growth is on).
  "MaxItemValue"                       limits the value of each piece of equipment given to the heroes (it's also subject to variance).
  "LooterUpgradeFactor"                this number * all looters are upgraded to local-culture tier 1 troops automatically (eg 0.25 means 25% of looters are upgraded).
  "MilitiaLimitFactor"                 the maximum number of Bandit Militia parties is this number * all non-caravan parties on the map.
  "MaxStrengthDelta"                   if set to 10, militias will ignore any parties more than 10% weaker (by power not headcount).  if set to 100, the militias will ignore all parties.
  "UpgradeUnitsFactor"                 troops getting upgraded (after looters) = this number * a random number 0-1 * total number of that troop type (eg 0.25 upgrades 0-25% of units).
