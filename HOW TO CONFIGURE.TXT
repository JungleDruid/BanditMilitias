  "CanTrain": true,                can be true or false, case insensitive.  False means they will never train.  True means they will train as XP and gold permit.
  "XPGift": "NORMAL",              can be LOW, NORMAL, HARD, HARDER, in CAPS.  Low grants NO XP on merges, while HARDER grants enough XP to significantly upgrade their troops.  No effect if CanTrain is false.                                         
  "CooldownHours": 24,             militias can't merge or split again before this much game time passes (minimum 1).
  "GoldReward": "NORMAL",          can be LOW, NORMAL, RICH, RICHER, in CAPS.  This scales with the strength of the party, regardless.
  "MinPartySize": 20,              integer.  Parties with fewer than this number of healthy troops will be dispersed, if defeated. 
  "MaxPartySize": 300,             integer lower than 2147483648.
  "RandomSplitChance": 0.25,       the daily probability a viable militia will split.
  "StrengthSplitFactor": 0.8,      militias will start randomly checking for split once they reach this threshold.           values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "SizeSplitFactor": 0.8,          militias will start randomly checking for split once they reach this threshold.           values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "PartyStrengthFactor": 0.8,      weakens the militias by scaling both strength and power to be less than the hero.         values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
  "MaxPartySizeFactor": 0.8        weakens the militias by scaling both strength and power to be less than the hero.         values over 1 skew the difficulty harder
