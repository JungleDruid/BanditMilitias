Please back up your save game or make a new checkpoint save or whatever.  You're responsible for your game integrity.

Press CTRL+ALT+N to remove all Bandit Militias from the world.  I suggest you do this once if you ran an earlier version, for a clean-slate.

The mod makes bandits merge and form Bandit Militia parties.  I'm trying to add splitting up, but it has proven difficult.

They have to be far enough away from their hideouts, notice each other by proximity, and meet a set of other criteria.

Just install it and the militias immediately start forming.

Militias form based on all these criteria being met:

    not being close to a hideout
    are not fleeing (anti-snowball)
    see another party in short range
    total count is less than the average hero-led max party size (and power-limited)
    not more than half cavalry

Right now by design "Bandit Boss" parties are ignored completely.
