Note there are hotkeys at the bottom to heavily mitigate the risk of trying the mod.  You nuke inconveniently-created militias.  
*Note these hotkeys are unfortunately not working quite right either.  WIP*

The mod makes all non-boss bandit parties that are far enough away from their hideouts, notice each other by proximity, and meet a set of circumstances merge and form a Bandit Militia parties.

Once per day there is a random chance that a party which is within a threshold of maximum size or strength will split in half becoming two Bandit Militia parties.  Prisoners are also split.  
Thanks to lostRD for this idea to make the militias more dynamic, and noticing they we merging too close to home.

*Just install it and the militias immediately start forming.*

Militias form based on all these criteria being met:

    not being close to any hideout
    are not fleeing (they won't snowball as you chase them)
    noticing another compatible party in (short) range (they do not seek each other out over distances)
    total count is less than the average hero-led max party size
    total power is within 75-125% the power of the player's party (not often met, weak bandit troops)
    militia is not more than half cavalry

Right now by design "Bandit Boss" parties are ignored; not affected.

These are kinda sorta but not fully working.
As an emergency measure, hotkeys are:
CTRL+ALT+X will kill any militias in sight with more than 50 members.
CTRL+ALT+Q will murder all Bandit Militias in your game, essentially removing the mod's effect (vanilla bandit parties aren't removed).
