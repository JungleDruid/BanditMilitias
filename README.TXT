The idea was to deal with the hordes of small parties of bandits that run all over the place.  Not particularly complicated.

It's experimental since I haven't seen the long term impact or in other player's scenarios.

Please back up your save game or make a new checkpoint save or whatever.  You're responsible for your game integrity.

Note there are hotkeys at the bottom to heavily mitigate the risk of trying the mod.  You nuke inconveniently-created militias.

What to expect:

    Fewer bandit parties, but no change in how they are spawning
    Some normal bandits
    Some militias will appear after a while and become more frequent as time passes


Right now no settings are exposed, just install it and the militias immediately start forming.

Militias form based on all these criteria being met:

    noticing another compatible party in (short) range (they do not seek each other out over distances)
    total count is less than the average hero-led max party size
    total power is within 75-125% the power of the player's party (not often met, weak bandit troops)
    militia is not more than half cavalry
    are not fleeing


Right now by design "Bandit Boss" parties are ignored; not affected.

As an emergency measure, hotkeys are:
CTRL+ALT+X will kill any militias in sight with more than 50 members.
CTRL+ALT+Q will murder all Bandit Militias in your game, essentially removing the mod's effect (vanilla bandit parties aren't removed).
