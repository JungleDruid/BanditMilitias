This mod brings bandit parties together, forming larger groups and hero level bandits rising to the top.  They also
split apart when they grow too large or powerful, forming separate militias that go and grow and split and so on.  

The heroes of each militia are carried forward into subsequent mergers so you will find parties with posses of bandit heroes, with a bunch of regular bandit troops.  They are also given a small amount of gold.
   
EXISTING PLAYERS please press CTRL+ALT+N one time to remove all Bandit Militias from the world.
This is to get a clean slate and mod stability depends on it.
   
Just install it and the militias immediately start forming based on all these criteria being met:

    not being close to a hideout
    are not fleeing (anti-snowball)
    troop count and power randomly vary in relation to world averages
    not more than half cavalry

Right now by design "Bandit Boss" parties are ignored completely.

Please back up your save game or make a new checkpoint save or whatever.  You're responsible for your game integrity.
